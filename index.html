    <p>The Telugu action film OG (which stands for "Original Gangster") stars Pawan Kalyan as Ojas Gambheera, a former gangster who returns to Mumbai after a 15-year absence to protect his loved ones from threats. Directed by Sujeeth, the movie also features Emraan Hashmi, Priyanka Mohan, and Prakash Raj. Its plot is a familiar gangster narrative with anime-inspired action sequences, but reviews suggest the film over-relies on style and fan-service rather than a strong story. </p>
